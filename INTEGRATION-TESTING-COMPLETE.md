## 🔧 **Resolved Technical Issues**

### **Database Schema Fix**
**Issue**: `ERROR: 22P02: invalid input syntax for type uuid: "cat_health"`

**Root Cause**: Sample data was trying to insert string IDs instead of UUIDs

**Solution Applied**:
```sql
-- Fixed category insertion (using auto-generated UUIDs)
INSERT INTO public.resource_categories (name, description, color, icon, sort_order) VALUES
    ('Health & Wellness', 'Medical care...', '#ef4444', 'fa-heartbeat', 1);

-- Fixed resource insertion (using subqueries for category lookup)
INSERT INTO public.resources (title, category_id, ...) VALUES
    ('Complete Sun Protection Guide', 
     (SELECT id FROM public.resource_categories WHERE name = 'Health & Wellness'),
     ...);
```
