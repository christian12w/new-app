# Footer Update Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure all pages have the same footer with automatic copyright year updating.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created copyright-year.js Script
- Created a unified JavaScript file that automatically updates copyright years across all pages
- The script updates elements with IDs or classes containing "current-year"
- Added to the js directory: `c:\Users\HP\Desktop\afz\js\copyright-year.js`

### 2. Updated Footer Templates
- **footer-template.html**: Updated to use dynamic year element and copyright-year.js script
- **about-footer-template.html**: Updated to use dynamic year element and copyright-year.js script
- **auth-footer-template.html**: Updated to use dynamic year element and copyright-year.js script

### 3. Updated Individual Pages
All pages were updated to include:
1. Dynamic year element with appropriate ID
2. Reference to copyright-year.js script

#### Pages updated:
- **index.html**: Updated footer to use dynamic year element and added copyright-year.js script reference
- **pages/about.html**: Added copyright-year.js script reference
- **pages/advocacy.html**: Added copyright-year.js script reference
- **pages/auth.html**: Added copyright-year.js script reference
- **pages/contact.html**: Updated hardcoded year to dynamic element and verified script reference

- **pages/programs.html**: Added copyright-year.js script reference
- **pages/resources.html**: Added copyright-year.js script reference

### 4. Key Features
- All footers now use the same design and structure
- Copyright year automatically updates to the current year
- Consistent script reference across all pages
- Backward compatible with existing functionality
- Works with different ID patterns (current-year, current-year-about, current-year-auth)

## Implementation Details

The copyright-year.js script uses a query selector to find all elements with IDs or classes containing "current-year" and updates their text content to the current year. This approach allows for flexibility in ID naming while ensuring all year elements are updated.

## Verification

All HTML files in the project have been checked and updated to ensure:
1. Each page has a footer with a dynamic year element
2. Each page includes the copyright-year.js script reference
3. No hardcoded years remain in footers
4. Script paths are correct for each page's directory structure
